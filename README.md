## Overview

Statblock is an application for Dungeons and Dragons enthusiasts to input thier gameplay stats with intention of making thier game play and organization easier.

### Description

- Dungeons and Dragons gameplay started with pen and paper. As an alternative to this tactile way of playing we thought to put it into digital form for ease of use.
- The digital format allows you to save and manipulate all the calculations on the fly. This means less time waisted time punching numbers or trying to read hand writing and more time enjoying the game.
- As an added bonus you can start where you left off without any interuptions because all information is saved in one easy to use place.

### User Story

## Acceptance Criteria

```
Your group will use everything you’ve learned throughout this course to create a MERN stack single-page application that works with real-world data to solve a real-world challenge, with a focus on data and user demand. This project will provide you with the best opportunity to demonstrate your problem-solving skills, which employers will want to see during interviews. Once again, the user story and acceptance criteria will depend on the project that you create, but your project must fulfill the following requirements:

- Use React for the front end.


- Use GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server.


- Use MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database.


- Use queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.


- Be deployed using Heroku (with data).


- Have a polished UI.


- Be responsive.


- Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).


- Include authentication (JWT).


- Protect sensitive API key information on the server.


- Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class and id naming conventions, indentation, high-quality comments, etc.).


- Have a high-quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

### CSS Styling

- Instead of using a CSS library like Bootstrap, consider one of the following suggestions:


- Look into the concept of CSS-in-JS, which abstracts CSS to the component level, using JavaScript to describe styles in a declarative and maintainable way. Some popular libraries include styled-components and Emotion.


- Try using a component library, such as Semantic UI, Chakra UI, or Ant Design.


- Create all the CSS for your application just using CSS.


- Ultimately, it doesn't matter which of these options you choose—it just needs to look professional and be mobile-friendly.

### Payment Platform

- Consider integrating the Stripe payment platform. Even if you don’t create an e-commerce application, you could set up your site to accept charitable donations.
